# Handling Client Interferene in SmartACE

By Scott Wesley in collaboration Maria Christakis, Arie Gurfinkel, Xinwen Hu,
Jorge Navas, Richard Trefler, and Valentin Wüstholz.

In the
[last tutorial](http://seahorn.github.io/smartace/verification/model%20checking/local%20reasoning/2020/06/15/smartace-local-reasoning-2.html),
we applied local reasoning to verify a contract with client state. The key
insight of our proof was summarizing the set of acceptable client interactions,
and then proving that this summary was never broken by interfering clients.
However, our example was deceptively simple. Namely, our summary included all
interactions, so it was trivially robust to interference.

In this tutorial, we consider a property which can be violated by certain client
interactions. To overcome this, we first define a summary of interactions which
excludes the bad examples. We then extend the SmartACE model to automatically
verify the robustness of this summary under interference.

To get started, let's define the smart contract, and the property of interest.

**Note**: This tutorial assumes all commands are run from within the
[SmartAce container](http://seahorn.github.io/smartace/install/docker/2020/06/08/smartace-installation.html).
All tutorial files are available within the container from the home directory.

## Extending Our Running Example

We consider another variation on the `Manager` bundle. In short, this bundle
implements a `Manager` contract which controls access to an `Auction` contract.
For those following on from past tutorials, the `Auction` contract is a
variation on our reoccurring `Fund` example. The `Auction` contract allows
clients to `deposit()` and `withdraw()` Ether, which is then aggregated in a
`bids` mapping.

The contract is designed such that maximum bid is strictly increasing. To
achieve this, the `maxBid` variable is used to recall the maximum bid. Net
deposits must alway exceed `maxBid` while withdraws must always be less than
`maxBid`.

```solidity
contract Auction {
    bool isOpen;
    address owner;

    uint256 maxBid;

    mapping(address => uint) bids;

    constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }

    // Access controls.
    modifier ownerOnly() { require(owner == msg.sender); _; }
    function releaseTo(address _new) public ownerOnly { owner = _new; }
    function open() public ownerOnly { isOpen = true; }
    function close() public ownerOnly { isOpen = false; }

    // Place a bid.
    function deposit() public payable {
        uint256 bid = bids[msg.sender] + msg.value;
        require(isOpen);
        require(bid > maxBid);
        bids[msg.sender] = bid;
        maxBid = bid;
    }

    // Withdraw a losing bid.
    function withdraw() public payable {
        uint256 bid = bids[msg.sender];
        require(isOpen);
        require(bid < maxBid);
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(bid);
    }
}

contract Manager {
    Auction auction;

    constructor() public { auction = new Auction(); }

    function openAuction() public { auction.open(); }
}
```

The contract is available
[here](https://github.com/ScottWe/smartace-examples/blob/master/tutorials/post-6/auction.sol).

## Defining the Property

The correctness of this contract rests on two key observations:

  1. No client's bid can ever exceed the maximum recorded bid.
  2. After bidding has started, some unique client always holds the maximum
     recorded bid.

In this tutorial we focus on property one. Let's start by making this statement
more precise.

> It is always the case that each deposit into `Auction.bids` is at most the
> value of `Auction.maxBid`.

Now we can translate the property into the
[VerX Specification Language](https://verx.ch/docs/spec.html). We note that this
property is universally quantified across all addresses. This requires notion
not seen in the previous tutorials. In particular, the VerX specification
language allows us to write `property p(X) { <Formula Over X> }`, to describe a
property quantified over all possible `X`. Therefore, our property becomes:

```
property p(X) {
    always(
        Auction.maxBid >= Auction.bids[X]
    )
}
```

## Compositional Reasoning Revisited

In the
[last tutorial](http://seahorn.github.io/smartace/install/docker/2020/06/08/smartace-installation.html),
we defined compositional invariants and adequate compositional invariants.
Intuitively, a compositional invariant is a summary of the client interactions,
while an adequate compositional invariant is such a summary which implies our
property of interest. Formally, an invariant is compositional if it satisfies:

  1. (Initialization) When the neighbourhood is zero-initialized, the data
     vertices satisfy the invariant.
  2. (Local Inductiveness) If the invariant holds for some clients before they
     perform a transaction, the invariant still holds afterwards.
  3. (Non-interference) If the invariant holds for some client, the actions of
     any other clients cannot break it.

Recall that a neighbourhood is a fixed set of interacting clients. If our
neighbourhoods are large enough, our proofs of correctness will generalize to
any number of clients. The details of this can be found in the
[last tutorial](http://seahorn.github.io/smartace/verification/model%20checking/local%20reasoning/2020/06/15/smartace-local-reasoning-2.html).

## Instrumenting the Smart Contract

The previous tutorials have gone into great detail on the instrumentation of
[local safety properties](http://seahorn.github.io/smartace/verification/local%20reasoning/2020/06/08/smartace-local-reasoning-1.html)
and
[adequacy checks](http://seahorn.github.io/smartace/verification/model%20checking/local%20reasoning/2020/06/15/smartace-local-reasoning-2.html).
Therefore, we focus our attention on the compositional invariant. We have two
challenges. First, we must find a candidate compositional invariant which is
adequate. Second, we must prove that this candidate formula is truly
compositional. As of now, the selection of candidate compositional invariant is
manual. However, we present the selection as a mechanical process.

Let's start by generating the model:

  * `solc auction.sol --bundle=Manager --c-model --output-dir=auction`
  * `cd auction ; mkdir build ; cd build`
  * `CC=clang-10 CXX=clang++-10 cmake ..`
  * `cmake --build . --target run-clang-format`

If we look to line 23 of `cmodel.c`, we see that `Auction.bids` retains 6
entries. This is because each neighbourhood of the bundle has at most 6 unique
clients. The first three clients designate `address(0)`, `address(Manager)`, and
`address(Auction)`, respectively. The final three clients are arbitrary, and can
represent any other client. A complete analysis for how we obtained this
neighbourhood can be found in a
[previous tutorial](http://seahorn.github.io/smartace/verification/local%20reasoning/2020/06/08/smartace-local-reasoning-1.html).

To improve the readability of our examples, we have replaced `contract_0` with
`manager_contract` and `contract_1` with `auction_contract`. For simplicity, we
will also encode the property as a simple `C` function. The function takes as
input a `Manager` bundle, and returns true if the configuration satisfies the
property:

```cpp
int property(struct Manager *c0, sol_address_t addr)
{
  sol_uint256_t bid = Read_Map_1(&(c0->user_auction.user_bids), addr);
  sol_uint256_t maximum = c0->user_auction.user_maxBid;
  return bid.v <= maximum.v;
}
```

Let's also add a placeholder function for the compositional invariant. As `True`
is always compositional, we will use that:

```cpp
int invariant(struct Manager *c0)
{
  return 1;
}
```

Throughout the rest of this example, we produce several variations of the model.
All variations are available online. The above instrumentation can be found at
line 213 of the
[first variation](https://github.com/ScottWe/smartace-examples/blob/master/tutorials/post-6/instrumented/cmodel_0.c).

### Attempt One: The `True` Compositional Invariant

We want to show that `forall x : clients :: property(Manager, x)` is an
inductive invariant of the contract. If we were to tackle this directly, we
would prove that the property held after constructing the bundle, and then
continued to hold after each transaction. However, in the local setting, we need
only prove that the compositional invariant implies the property. This is
because the compositional invariant summarizes all possible clients.

Now recall that for each neighbourhood of this contract, there are at most six
distinct clients. The first three of these clients are distinguished, and
therefore persist across all neighbourhoods. The final three addresses are
representative, and may vary from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. As before, we
encode the representative clients using non-determinism. To simplify our
presentation we, introduce the following macro:

```cpp
#DEFINE HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(map, i, msg) \
  Write_Map_1(map, Init_sol_address_t(i), Init_sol_uint256(nd_uint256(msg)));
```

Once we have selected a neighbourhood, we directly assert that it satisfies the
property. We do this by substituting each of the six addresses for `x`. This
gives us the
[second variation](https://github.com/ScottWe/smartace-examples/blob/master/tutorials/post-6/instrumented/cmodel_1.c),
as outlined below:

```cpp
/* ... Contract initialization ... */

while (sol_continue()) {
  // [START] INSTRUMENTATION (LINE 250)
  /* Reached upon initialization, and after each iteration. */
  /* First we construct an arbitrary network. */
  HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(&auction_contract->user_bids, 3, "bids[3]");
  HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(&auction_contract->user_bids, 4, "bids[4]");
  HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(&auction_contract->user_bids, 5, "bids[5]");
  sol_require(invariant(&manager_contract), "Bad arrangement.");
  /* Next, we check the property against this arbitrary neighbourhood. */
  sol_assert(property(&manager_contract, Init_sol_address_t(0)), "Address 0 violates Prop.");
  /* ... */
  sol_assert(property(&manager_contract, Init_sol_address_t(5)), "Address 5 violates Prop.");
  // [ END ] INSTRUMENTATION

  /* ... Call setup ... */

  /* We allow the same local neighbourhood to run the transaction. */
  switch (next_call) { /* ... Run transactions ... */ }
}
```

#### The Adequacy Test

We can check this model by running `cmake --build . --target verify`. This shows
that the property does not hold. To get some more insight, let's enable logging
and generate a witness:

  * `cmake .. -DSEA_EXELOG=true`
  * `cmake --build . --target witness`

We obtain the following concise trace.

```
[Initializing manager_contract and children]
sender [uint8]: 3
blocknum [uint256]: 0
timestamp [uint256]: 0
[Entering transaction loop]
bids[3] [uint256]: 1
bids[4] [uint256]: 0
bids[5] [uint256]: 0
assert: Address 3 violates Prop.
[sea] __VERIFIER_error was executed
```

If we go to the assertion associated with `assert: Address 3 violates Prop` we
find that `bids[3] <= maxBid` has failed. If we walk back through the trace, we
find the root cause of this problem, namely `bids[3] [uint256]: 1`. This says
that `bids[3]` was assigned to a value larger than the maximum bid. Clearly,
this assignment is not feasible.

### Attempt Two: A Refined Compositional Invariant

From the above analysis, we can see that the counterexample was spurious. Let's
try to refine our compositional invariant given this trace. Perhaps we can do
this with a linear relationship between `bids[3]` and one of the program
variables. The obvious candidate is `bids[3] <= maxBid`. As `address(3)`
corresponds to an arbitrary client, it is likely that our invariant generalizes
to all clients. This gives us the new candidate shown below. The loop equates to
checking `bids[i] <= maxBid` for each client in the neighbourhood.

```cpp
int invariant(struct Manager *c0)
{
  sol_uint256_t maximum = c0->user_auction.user_maxBid;
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i)
  {
    sol_address_t addr = Init_sol_address_t(i);
    sol_uint256_t bid = Read_Map_1(&(c0->user_auction.user_bids), addr);
    if (bid.v > maximum.v) return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}
```

We can find the new model variation
[here](https://github.com/ScottWe/smartace-examples/blob/master/tutorials/post-6/instrumented/cmodel_2.c).
If we rerun `cmake --build . --target verify` we see that this candidate is
indeed adequate.

However, we still have yet to prove the compositionality of our new candidate.
We can automate this check by instrumenting one final model. We do this by
encoding `Initialization`, `Local Inductiveness` and `Non-interference` as
program assertions.

The check for `Local Inductiveness` follows directly from the definition. The
check of `Initialization` is somewhat more nuanced. The challenge here is that
after initialization, our view is of the neighbourhood which was acted on by the
constructor. In reality, all other representatives are zero initialized, and may
therefore be in a different state than those in the neighbourhood. We must check
that all such neighbourhoods satisfy the invariant.

The `Non-interference` check generalizes the challenge faced by the
`Initialization` check. Here we must consider pairs of neighbourhoods. One
neighbourhood is fixed before the transition takes place, while the other takes
part directly in the transition. As these neighbourhoods are arbitrary, it is
possible that a representative in the first neighbourhood overlaps with some
representative in the second neighbourhood. In such a case, the post-state of
this representative must be reflected in both neighbourhoods.

A naive solution to either problem is to encode each case explicitly. However,
the number of cases grows exponentially with the number of representatives. A
more sophisticated solution is to select one of the exponentially many cases
through non-determinism. This insight motivates the following two tricks, and in
turn, reduces the problem to a linear number of binary decisions.

  1. To simulate an external process, we compute two neighbourhoods for the same
     program state, and cache the first result. This simulates an untouched
     neighbourhood.
  2. When checking `Initialization` and `Non-interference` we use three
     non-deterministic flag variables to model overlap between the two
     neighbourhoods. If the i-th variable is true, the i-th client is shared.

To follow along, this last variation is available
[here](https://github.com/ScottWe/smartace-examples/blob/master/tutorials/post-6/instrumented/cmodel_3.c)

```cpp
/* ... Contract initialization ... */

// [START] INSTRUMENTATION (LINE 256)
/* We select some initial neighbourhood. Maps are zero-initialized. */
sol_uint256_t ZERO = Init_sol_uint256_t(0);
if (nd_range(0, 2, "Use external address(3)")) {
  Write_Map_1(&auction_contract->user_bids, Init_sol_address_t(3), ZERO);
}
if (nd_range(0, 2, "Use external address(4)")) {
  Write_Map_1(&auction_contract->user_bids, Init_sol_address_t(4), ZERO);
}
if (nd_range(0, 2, "Use external address(5)")) {
  Write_Map_1(&auction_contract->user_bids, Init_sol_address_t(5), ZERO);
}
sol_assert(invariant(&manager_contract), "Initialization is violated.");
// [ END ] INSTRUMENTATION

while (sol_continue()) {
  // [START] INSTRUMENTATION (LINE 270)
  /* Select and cache an arbitrary neighbourhood to check non-interference. */
  HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(&auction_contract->user_bids, 3, "external bids[3]");

  sol_require(invariant(&manager_contract), "Bad arrangement.");
  // [ END ] INSTRUMENTATION

  // [START] INSTRUMENTATION (LINE 284)
  /* Select a new neighbourhood to take a step. */
  sol_bool_t share_addr_3 = Init_sol_bool_t(nd_range(0, 2, "Share address(3)"));
  if (!share_addr_3.v)
  {
    HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(&auction_contract->user_bids, 3, "bids[3]");
  }
  sol_bool_t share_addr_4 = Init_sol_bool_t(nd_range(0, 2, "Share address(4)"));
  if (!share_addr_4.v)
  {
    HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(&auction_contract->user_bids, 4, "bids[4]");
  }
  sol_bool_t share_addr_5 = Init_sol_bool_t(nd_range(0, 2, "Share address(5)"));
  if (!share_addr_5.v)
  {
    HAVOC_MAP_1_ENTRY(&auction_contract->user_bids, 5, "bids[5]");
  }
  sol_require(invariant(&manager_contract), "Bad arrangement.");
  // [ END ]

  /* ... Call setup ... */

  switch (next_call) { /* ... Run transactions ... */ }

  // [START] INSTRUMENTATION (LINE 347)
  sol_assert(invariant(&manager_contract), "Local Inductiveness is violated.");
  // [ END ] INSTRUMENTATION

  // [START] INSTRUMENTATION (LINE 349)
  /* Checks non-interference, taking into account overlapping neighbourhoods. */
  if (!share_addr_3.v) {
    Write_Map_1(&auction_contract->user_bids, Init_sol_address_t(3), extern_3);
  }
  if (!share_addr_4.v) {
    Write_Map_1(&auction_contract->user_bids, Init_sol_address_t(4), extern_4);
  }
  if (!share_addr_5.v) {
    Write_Map_1(&auction_contract->user_bids, Init_sol_address_t(5), extern_5);
  }
  sol_assert(invariant(&manager_contract), "Non-interference is violated.");
  // [ END ] INSTRUMENTATION
}
```

#### The Compositionality Test

If we rerun `cmake --build . --target verify`, all assertions will hold. This
proves that our candidate obeys `Initialization`, `Local Inductiveness`, and
`Non-interference`. Seahorn did not produce an invariant, so the candidate was
strong enough on its own. In other words, we have found the adequate
compositional invariant for our property.

#### Some Additional Remarks on Refinement

Let's assume that the second candidate compositional invariant also failed. By
failing the compositionality test and passing the adequacy test, we would know
that the candidate was too strong. We would need to expand the summary to
account for the missing interactions. This is similar to when we restricted the
summary after failing an adequacy test.

In principle, we could repeat this procedure until finding (or failing to find)
an adequate compositional invariant. As each summary associates a finite space
of shared contract variables to a finite space of local neighbourhoods, we
could enumerate all possible candidates in theory. In practice, most of these
variables would range over 256-bit integers, and therefore, enumerating the
entire space would be infeasible. Automating this search is the topic of future
work.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we saw how to test the compositionality of a given candidate
compositional invariant. We used this insight to prove the correctness of a
global client property. We also motivated a procedure to find compositional
invariants. This concludes our three part series on the foundations of local
reasoning. In the next tutorial, we will explore more challenging applications
of local reasoning in smart contracts.
