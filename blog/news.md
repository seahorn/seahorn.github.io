## Open Position ##

We have 2 open postdoctoral research scholar positions:

### Postdoc position in static and dynamic analysis of Android OS ###

We invite applications for a postdoctoral research scholar position in the [CAVA][cava] project. The position is based at the [Silicon Valley][sv] campus of [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu].  Candidates must have (or close to obtain) a Ph.D. in Computer Science or a closely related area with a specialization in automated reasoning. Individuals with expertise in:

* Android OS
* Symbolic execution
* Model checking
* SAT/SMT 
* Fault diagnosis 

are encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will have excellent coding skills (Java, C++, Python), strong communication skills, and ability to work independently and in a dynamic team environment. The candidate will also partially contribute to the development of two verification frameworks: [SeaHorn][seahorn] and [JayHorn][jayhorn].
